<h2 id="hello-world">Hello World!</h2>
<p>My name is Rasoul (Persian: رسول) and I was born in <em>Kerman</em>, a historical and cultural city located in South-East of Iran. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Computer Engineering dept., Boston University. I am a doctoral research assistant at <em>Seclab</em> under supervision of <a href="http://megele.io">Prof. Manuel Egele</a>. I did my master’s in Computer Engineering at the Department of CSE and IT of Amirkabir University of technology.</p>


<h2 id="research-interest">Research Interest</h2>

<p>I am broadly interested in the field of system security.
My current researches revolve around time and space vulnerabilities in Java applications and PHP remote code execution vulnerabilities. By sandboxing web applications and recording information about function calls in the web application, I look for building a profile for web applications and build a system for granting or denying permission to execute system calls. There are various approaches in the field for discovering such vulnerabilities but I think we have our own approach that might work! ;)
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
