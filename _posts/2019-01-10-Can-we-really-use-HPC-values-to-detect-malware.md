title: Detecting malware using HPC values
---

HPCs are hardware units that count the occurrences of micro-architectural events such as instruction counts, hits and misses in various cache levels and branch (mis)predictions during runtime.
There have been many researches recently about detecting malware using HPC values. The common assumption for all these research is that malicious behavior affects HPC values differently than benign behavior. Consider a ransomeware and a file encryptor tool; both these applications uses cryptographic key to encrypt the files to safeguard the data for a purpose, one is malicious and the other is benign. How can we detect the difference between their behavior using HPC values. To know more I refer you to our paper which was published in ASIACCS 2018.
